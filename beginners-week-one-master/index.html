  <h2>What is animal cruelty?</h2>
  <!-- image of a duck -->
  <img src="" width="200px">
  <p>Animal cruelty involves gratuitously inflicting harm, injuring, or killing an animal.
     The cruelty can be intentional, such as kicking, burning, stabbing, beating, or shooting; or it can involve neglect, such as depriving an animal of water, shelter, food, and necessary medical treatment.
      Animal fighting, in which animals are trained or forced to attack each other in violent confrontations at the risk of grave injury or death, is another form of animal cruelty.
      Animal cruelty encompasses a range of behaviors harmful to animals, from neglect to malicious killing.
      Most cruelty investigated by humane officers is unintentional neglect that can be resolved through education.

  <h2><em>Why would anyone be cruel to animals?</em></h2>
  There can be many reasons. Animal cruelty, like any other form of violence, is often committed by a person who feels powerless, unnoticed or under the control of others.
  The motive may be to shock, threaten, intimidate or offend others or to demonstrate rejection of society's rules.
  Some who are cruel to animals copy acts they have seen or that have been done to them.
  Others see harming an animal as a safe way to get revenge against—or threaten—someone who cares about that animal

  <h2><em>Is there any evidence of a connection between animal cruelty and human violence?</em></h2>

 Absolutely. Many studies in psychology, sociology and criminology in the past
 25 years have demonstrated that violent offenders frequently have childhood
 and adolescent histories of serious and repeated animal cruelty.

 Other research has shown consistent patterns of animal cruelty among perpetrators of other forms of violence, including child abuse, spousal abuse and elder abuse.
 In fact, the American Psychiatric Association considers animal cruelty one of the diagnostic criteria of conduct disorder.

 <h2><em>What happens when authorities prosecute an animal cruelty case?</em></h2>
 Depending on the severity of the case, those convicted of animal cruelty can be imprisoned.
 Appropriate sentencing can also include individual or family counseling, community service,
 placement in a diversion program and a prohibition on owning or caring for animals.
 <div>
 It is rarely the goal of police to imprison a child for cruelty to animals.
 Law enforcement officers and judges recognize that cruelty to animals is one part of a complex problem.
 Sometimes, the official response to animal cruelty provides a family its first opportunity to get help.

 <h2><em>Can reports be made anonymously?</em></h2>
 While many jurisdictions will respond to an anonymous complaint, successful prosecutions often depend on an identifiable witness who can authenticate evidence.

<h2><em>What can i do to help stop animal neglect?</em></h2>
Be aware of the signs of animal neglect—including chained dogs, animal hoarding, or abandoned pets
and be willing to make a report to your local animal control agency.
If your town or city does not have a local animal control, you can make a report to the sheriff or other law enforcement agency.
(You may remain anonymous when filing a report.)
<div>
  In most cases, the education and monitoring of the neglect situation is best left to your community's law enforcement professionals.
